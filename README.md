# ‚ö° GrindGraph: Visualizing the Fitness Grind

## Project Overview

**GrindGraph** is a comprehensive Data Analytics and Visualization project built using Python and Streamlit. It analyzes daily activity, sleep, and calorie expenditure data from a FitBit fitness tracker dataset to uncover user habits, correlations between lifestyle metrics, and key performance indicators. This project showcases proficiency in data wrangling, advanced EDA, and interactive dashboard deployment.

**Project Type:** Data Analytics & Visualization Portfolio Project
**Data Source:** FitBit Fitness Tracker Dataset (Two Merged Exports)
**Key Insight:** Identifying the 'sweet spot' for sleep duration that correlates with peak daily activity (steps).

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Tools

* **Python:** The core language for analysis and application logic.
* **Pandas & NumPy:** Essential libraries for data manipulation and cleaning.
* **Plotly Express:** Used for creating the three key interactive and aesthetic visualizations.
* **Streamlit:** Used for rapidly building and deploying the interactive web dashboard.
* **Jupyter:** Used for initial Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

## üìä Key Analytical Features & Visualizations

The dashboard provides three primary interactive views to explore fitness habits:

1.  **Steps vs. Calories Burned (Scatter Plot):** Analyzes the strength and linearity of the relationship between steps and energy expenditure, highlighting how **Very Active Minutes** (color) contribute beyond simple step count.
2.  **Average Steps by Day of Week (Bar Chart):** Reveals user activity trends, identifying peak activity days (e.g., weekends) versus trough activity days (e.g., mid-week).
3.  **Sleep vs. Total Steps (Scatter Plot):** Explores the correlation between the **Total Minutes Asleep** and **Total Steps** taken the following day, pinpointing the sleep range required for optimal activity.
