# GrindGraph: Visualizing the Fitness Grind

## Project Overview

**GrindGraph** isn't just an app; it's a deep dive into daily hustle data using **Python** and **Streamlit**. We took a raw FitBit dataset, merged a chaotic minute-by-minute sleep log, and delivered **actionable tea** on activity habits, sleep correlation, and calorie burns.

It's **100% portfolio-ready**, showing skills in data wrangling, advanced EDA, and full-stack data deployment.

##  The Stack (The Tools That Ate)

We kept the tech stack **clean and efficient** to maximize impact:

| Category | Tools Used | Why It's the Goat  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Data Engine** | `Python`, **Pandas**, `NumPy` | For merging those messy, mismatched CSVs and cleaning the data (iykyk). |
| **Visualization** | **Plotly Express** | Because static charts are cringe. Plotly gives us those smooth, interactive, zoomable visuals. |
| **Deployment** | **Streamlit** | Turning a Python script into a public, shareable web app in minutes. |
| **Environment** | `Jupyter`, `venv` | Local testing, robust environment isolation, and clean dependencies. |

## Key Insights & Visuals

The dashboard features **three primary interactive visualizations** designed to extract the most valuable insights:

### 1. Steps vs. Calories (The Energy Check)
* **What it shows:** The fundamental link between physical activity and energy output.
* **The Tea:** We use color to show **Very Active Minutes**, proving that intensity matters way more than just clocking steps.

### 2. Average Steps by Day of Week (The Habit Vibe)
* **What it shows:** Which days are peak grind and which days people take a chill pill.
* **The Tea:** Pinpoints the **"Weekend Warrior"** effect in the user population, vital for targeted fitness campaigns.

### 3. Sleep vs. Activity (The Secret Sauce)
* **What it shows:** The correlation between Total Minutes Asleep and Total Steps taken.
* **The Tea:** Discovers the **optimal sleep "sweet spot"** (typically 5 to 10 hours) required to maximize daily activity, proving balanced rest fuels the best performance.

## Get the Local Setup (Run It Back)

Wanna clone it and run it on your own machine? It's simple:

1.  **Clone the Repo:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/harshithreddy-dev/GrindGraph.git](https://github.com/harshithreddy-dev/GrindGraph.git)
    cd GrindGraph
    ```

2.  **Setup the Environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
    # source venv/bin/activate # Mac/Linux
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Data Check:** Make sure the original downloaded FitBit CSVs (including the two merged folders) are placed inside the **`data/`** directory.

5.  **Run the Dashboard:**
    ```bash
    cd app
    streamlit run dashboard.py
    ```
    (The app will open automatically at `http://localhost:8501`).
